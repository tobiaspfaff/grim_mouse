Description: Interpreter for several 3D games
 ResidualVM is a cross-platform 3D game interpreter which allows you to
 play LucasArts' LUA-based 3D adventures: Grim Fandango and
 Escape from Monkey Island, provided you already have their data files.
 .
 ResidualVM just replaces the executables shipped with the games,
 allowing you to play them on systems for which they were never designed!
